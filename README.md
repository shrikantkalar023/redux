### Functional Programming Section

1. To solve problems using small & reusable fns which receive input & give output. They dont MUTATE data.

2. In JS fns can be treated as any other objs.

   -assigned to a var.

   -passed as argument.

   -returned from other fns.

3. Higher Order Fns: takes fn as input or returns it or both.
